4. Reverting the code changes in git. Deletion is not permanent in git.
 a. git checkout <sha1value>
 b. copy the file into some other location
 c. git checkout master
 d. copy the file from (b. location) to your git repo location.
 e. "git status" and "git add ." and <git commit -m "Commit message"> and <git push origin master>

5. Branching
 Create a new branch with base as master: git branch <newbranch> master
 create a new branch and checkout with base as develop (develop branch should exists in your local): git checkour -b <newbranch> develop/<urbasebranch>
 Show all the local Branch: git branch
 Show the remote branchs: git branch -r
 Show all the branchs local and remote: git branch -a
 Create the new branch without specifying base branch: git branch <new-branch>
 Create a branch from commit: git branch <branchname> <hashcommitid>
 Create a branch from a tag: git branch <tagbranchname> <tagname>

7. Merging
   Merging is the way to propagate your changes from one branch to another branch. Follow the below steps to merge one branch to another branch.
   Example: Suppose My latest code is in feature/loginchanges branch and I have to merge the feature/loginchanges into develop branch. develop is target and feature/loginchanges is source branch.
   Step 1: checkout the target branch where you have to merge- for above ex - git checkout develop
   Step 2: Run the git merge command. Ex: git merge feature/loginchanges
   Step 3: Code will be merged. If there are any code conflict, git will not merge the code and merge conflict error will come.
   Step 4: resolve the merge conflict.
   Step 5: Once merge conflict is resolved then push the merge to remote repos.
   Types of Merge in GIT:
   1. Fast Forward merge
   2. Recursive merge
8. Pull Request
   In their simplest form, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Developer creates PR request
   when one feature is completed and ready to merge.

Step 1: Install the required packages. below required pkgs are required to update.
# sudo yum install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel
# sudo yum install  gcc perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker

Step 2: Uninstall old git
# sudo yum remove git

Step 3: Download and compile git source binary
# cd /usr/src
# wget <git binary url>
# tar -zxvf <git file>

# cd /usr/src/<git extracted folder>
# make prefix=/usr/local/git all
# make prefix=/usr/local/git install
# echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin' >> /etc/bashrc
# echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin' > /etc/profile.d/git.sh
# source /etc/bashrc

Step 4: Check git version
# git --version
