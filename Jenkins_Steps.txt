Jenkisn is a Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment tool. Jenkins is build process automation tool.
We have many tools for CI/CD like Jenkins/Teamcity/Bamboo/Azure DevOps/GITLAB/etc.
Jenkins is free/open source tool and very powerful.

We need to have java 1.8 installed on our machine before installing jenkins.

2. How to set up Jenkins?
 Step 1: First download the tomcat application server from apache tomact website. wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.34/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.34.tar.gz
 Step 2: Go to /opt/tools and run the comma "wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.34/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.34.tar.gz"
 Step 3: Extract the package. Go to the directory where you ahve downloaded the tomact and extarct "tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-9.0.34.tar.gz"
 Step 4: apache-tomact tar will be extracted and one folder will come "apache-tomcat-9.0.34".
 Step 5: Download the jenkins war file at your tools folder. "wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.249.1/jenkins.war"
 Step 6: Copy the jenkins.war into your tomcat/webapps folder. "cp jenkins.war /opt/tools/apache-tomcat-9.0.34/webapps
 Step 7: Go to tomact bin directtory. cd /opt/tools/apache-tomact-9.0./bin
 Step 8: Start the tomact server from bin directory. "sh startup.sh"
 Step 9: Change the inbound rules in your AWS virtual machine and allow inbound rules port 8080.
 Step 10: Access the tomcat on this url. http://<ur public ip>:8080
 Step 11: Access the jenins application at this url. http://<ur public ip>:8080/jenkins
 Step 12: See the initial password and Provide the initial password. cat /home/ec2-user/.jenkins/********.
 Step 13: Create the user as admin/aything name and install the suggested plugin.
 Step 14: Access the jenkins application. http://<ur public ip>:8080/jenkins
 Step 15: To check if tomcat or any process is running. Command is - "ps -ef | grep <processname>" Ex: "ps -ef | grep tomcat"
 
3. Types of Pipeline in jenkins
  a. Free style Pipeline Jobs
